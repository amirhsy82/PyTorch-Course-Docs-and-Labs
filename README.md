PyTorch is a popular open source deep learning framework that empowers developers to create high-performance AI models with relative ease. This repository contains comprehensive course materials, lecture notes, lab scripts, and resources for an extensive PyTorch tutorial designed by experts in the field of machine learning and
artificial intelligence. The goal is to provide learners at begining levels, a thorough understanding of key concepts through interactive labs with hands-on experience using real datasets.

## Setup Instructions ##
Before diving into this repository, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed (if you want to run locally):
